### Description 

This is a react weather application. It allows the user to search for a city, and displays the current weather conditions for that city, along with daily forecasts. The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. The app is built using the Bootstrap framework for styling and the Axios library for making HTTP requests to retrieve weather data from OpenWeather API.
